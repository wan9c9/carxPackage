\title{Select a \code{carx} model by the AIC}
\usage{
carxSelect(formulas, max.ar, data = list(), detect.outlier = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formulas}{a regression formula or a  list of regression formulas.}

\item{max.ar}{the maximal AR order.}

\item{data}{a \code{CenTS} object containing the data and censored information.}

\item{detect.outlier}{logical to specify whether outlier detection is performed (and incorporating in 
the \code{carx} model any found additive outliers) before computing the AIC for a model. Default = \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{other arguments to be supplied, if not null, it will be called with the selected model and data. 
Examples include \code{CI.compute=TRUE}, which will cause the function to re-estimate the selected model with the confidence 
intervals computed, as in the selection part, no confidence interval is  computed.}
}
\value{
a list consisting of:
\itemize{
\item{\code{fitted}}{ the fitted CARX object of the model with the smallest AIC.}
\item{\code{aicMat}}{ the matrix of AIC where rows correspond to the model formulas and columns correspond to the AR orders.}
}
}
\description{
This function selects the \code{carx} model which minimizes the AIC among a set of \code{carx} models
 defined by a set of  formulas or a list of regression formulas with a maximal AR order.
The model specification is supplied by \code{formulas} which can be either a formula or a list of formulas.
For each formula, the function will estimate the \code{carx} models with the AR order
 from 1 to \code{max.ar} inclusive.
If \code{detect.outlier=TRUE}, outlier detection will be performed for each combination of model 
formula and AR order.
The function returns a \code{list} which consists of: 1)  \code{aicMat} which is a matrix of AIC
values where 
each row contains the AICs of the model given by a specific regression formula with the AR order 
ranging from 1 to \code{mar.ar} 
(after incorporation of any found outlier if outlier detection if enabled), and 
2) \code{fitted} which is the fitted object of the selected model.
