#' \code{carx}: A package to fit Censored AutoRegressive model with eXogenous
#' covariates (CARX), which can also be viewed as regression models with possibly
#' censored responses
#' and autoregressive residuals. \code{carx} allows left, right, or interval
#' censoring for the response variable. The regression errors are assumed to
#' follow an autoregressive model with normal innovations. This package also
#' contains functions to predict the future values, diagnose whether the model is
#' adequate, and plot functions to illustrate the data and model.
