#' @title The total phosphorus concentration and river discharge data of West Fork Cedar River at Finchford, Iowa.
#'
#' @description This data contains the monthly total phosphorus concentration (P) and river discharge
#' (Q) of
#' West Fork Cedar River at Finchford, Iowa, USA, from 10/1998 to 10/2013. The P
#' data were collected under the ambient water quality program conducted by the
#' Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The Q data were obtained from U.S.
#' Geological Survey. A gap from 09/2008 to 03/2009 in the data are due to
#' program suspension owing to lack
#' of fund. The data contains \code{logP} and \code{logQ} which are the
#' logarithm of the original P and Q respectively. The P data are left censored,
#' with -1 or 0 in \code{censorIndicator} indicating that the corresponding observation is left censored or
#' observed. The lower censoring limits are stored in \code{lowerCensorLimit}.
